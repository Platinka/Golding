      <h3 id="headline">Who Was William Golding?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Sir William Gerald Golding was a British writer, poet and playwright born on 19th September <strong>1911</strong> in Newquay, Cornwall</li>
        <li>
           He was a graduate in <strong>1934</strong> receiving his B.A honors in English Literature. The same year he published his first book titles ‘Poems’.
        </li>
        <li>
           Golding got married in <strong>1939</strong> to Ann Brookfield who was an analytical chemist. They had two children. Shortly after their marriage, Golding got a job as a schoolmaster. The next year, Golding enlisted in the Royal Navy and fought in the Second World War. He was involved in various missions before the war ended. Golding returned home safe to start a normal life teaching Philosophy and English as before.
        </li>
        <li>
           In <strong>1953</strong>, nearly a decade later, Golding wrote a novel that was to become the reason for his success.
        </li>
        <li>
           Although his publisher demanded some editing in the work, the book was finally published in <strong>1954</strong> named ‘Lord of the Flies’ that was very well received.
        </li>
        <li>
           William Golding decided to devote all his time to writing so in <strong>1961</strong> he resigned from his post at Bishop Wordsworth’s School. He spent the rest of the years as a writer in residence at Hollins College in Virginia. 
        </li>
        <li>
          His first novel was followed by others including ‘The Inheritors’ in <strong>1955</strong>, ‘Pincher Martin’ in <strong>1955</strong> and ‘Free Fall’ that was published in <strong>1956</strong>. Other novels by Golding are ‘The Spire’ <strong>(1964)</strong>, ‘The Pyramid’ <strong>(1967)</strong>, ‘Darkness Visible’ <strong>(1979)</strong>, ‘To the Ends of the Earth’ trilogy (<strong>1980</strong>, <strong>1987</strong>, and <strong>1989</strong>) and ‘The Double Tongue’ that was published posthumously in 1995.
        </li>
        <li>
          Golding also wrote short fiction, plays and essays. He also authored a travel book. His play was called ‘The Brass Butterfly’. His essays include ‘The Hot Gates’ <strong>(1965)</strong>, ‘A Moving Target’ <strong>(1982)</strong> and ‘An Egyptian Journal’ <strong>(1985)</strong>. William Golding also had some works that were unpublished. These included an account of the D-Day training whilst sailing on the south coast of London. It was called ‘Seahorse’ and was written by Golding in <strong>1948</strong>. He wrote a novel named ‘Circle under the Sea’ which was about an ambitious writer who uncovers archaeological treasures on Isles of Scilly. His third unpublished work was a novel called ‘Short Measure’.
        </li>
        <li>
          William Golding’s writing style mostly used classical literature, Christian symbolism and mythology and all his novels are distinct from each other. There is no common plot or story however all of them are set on villages and island, courts and monasteries; mostly closed settings. Golding was nominated as a candidate for ‘Chancellorship’ of the University of Kent, Canterbury but lost. He was honored with awards such as the ‘James Tait Black Memorial Prize’ in 1979, the Booker Prize in <strong>1980</strong>. He was given the Nobel Prize for Literature in <strong>1983</strong>. He was awarded the title of ‘Sir’ by the Queen in <strong>1988</strong>. The Times included him in the list of ‘The 50 Greatest British Writers since 1945’.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sir William Golding died of heart failure in his home at Perranarworthal, near Truro, Cornwall, on June 19, <strong>1993</strong>. He was buried in Holy Trinity churchyard, Bowerchalke, Wiltshire, England. He left the draft of a novel, The Double Tongue, which was published posthumously (Faber, <strong>1996</strong>).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="headline">Fiction</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Golding's often allegorical fiction makes broad use of allusions to classical literature, mythology, and Christianity symbolism. Although no distinct thread unites his novels and his technique varies, Golding deals principally with evil and emerges with what has been characterized as a kind of dark optimism. Golding's first novel, Lord of the Flies (1954; films in 1963 and 1990), introduced one of the recurrent themes of his fiction—the conflict between humanity's innate barbarism and the civilizing influence of reason. The Inheritors (1955) reaches into prehistory, advancing the thesis that mankind's evolutionary ancestors, "the fire-builders," triumphed over a gentler race as much by violence and deceit as by natural superiority. In Pincher Martin (1956) Golding explores the conflict between the good and evil aspects of our nature again as that given to us at birth and what we change it into by our own will, even to the point of futilely challenging our very existence and its demise. The novel caused a great controversy in the humanistic and relativistic literary world of his time, including calls for him to rewrite the ending. Golding sought in several interviews to explain his intent and the “meaning” of the story in religious terms. This so backfired on him that he never again would explain his work, only referring the reader to what he derives from the story. In Free Fall (1959), he explores how the consequences of our actions make us who we have become, using flashbacks. The Spire (1964) is an allegory concerning the protagonist's obsessive determination to build a great cathedral spire, regardless of the consequences.</li>
        <li>William Golding has made quite an impact on the world with his most famous work, Lord of the Flies. This novel about a group of young upper class English schoolboys deserted on an island is now required reading in most high schools in America. Based on the premise that human nature, including that of well-bred children, is inherently evil, this book delivers a frightening view of mankind. It has become a modern classic. It has challenged many people’s perspectives on human nature in a way that few other books have. It has assured Golding of his position as one of the most important writers of the post-war period.</li>
        <li>Golding's later novels include Darkness Visible (1979), in which he explores dual possibilities of fate in our inner response to tragedies through the twin orphans after World War II, and The Paper Men (1984), about the unraveling of pretentious literary and academic figures. He also wrote a historical sea trilogy To the Ends of the Earth, which includes Rites of Passage (Booker Prize, 1981), Close Quarters (1987), and Fire Down Below (1989). These books frame a critical exposé of British class attitudes of the nineteenth century in a long sea voyage from England to Australia. It has been produced as a BBC drama series.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="headline">Lord of the Flies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ord of the Flies is an allegorical novel about a group of young boys who are stranded on a desert island and subsequently attempt to govern themselves, a task at which they fail disastrously. Its stances on the already controversial subjects of human nature and individual welfare versus the common good earned it position 70 on the American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000.</li>
        <li>Published in 1954, Lord of the Flies was Golding's first novel, and although it was not a great success at the time —selling fewer than 3,000 copies in the United States during 1955 before going out of print—it soon went on to become a bestseller, and by the early 1960s was required reading in many schools and colleges. It was adapted to film in 1963 by Peter Brook, and again in 1990 by Harry Hook.</li>
        <li>The title is a reference to the Hebrew name Beelzebub (בעל זבוב, Baal-zvuv, "god of the fly" or "host of the fly") a name sometimes used as a synonym for Satan.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="headline">Literary significance and criticism</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Many people have interpreted Lord of the Flies as a work on moral philosophy. The environment of the island, a paradise with food, water, and all the necessities, is a metaphor for the Garden of Eden. The first appearance of the "beastie" is in a form reminiscent of a serpent, as which evil appears in the Book of Genesis. One of the major themes of the book, on the very nature of evil, is brought to a head in a scene which Simon holds with the head of the pig, which is known as "The Lord of the Flies" (a literal translation of the Hebrew name of Ba'alzevuv, or Beelzebub, which is a powerful demon in hell, sometimes believed to be the devil himself). The conversation held also points to Simon as the character representing religion and good will in the novel, which is reminiscent of the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness. Some Christian readers allude the British Naval officers' rescue of the boys as the second coming of Christ (Bible story in Revelation). The "Lord of the Flies" in the end reveals that evil and the terror of the "beastie" is not an external threat, but an inborn evil with the boys themselves.</li>
        <li>Others have looked at the novel as a work on political philosophy. The stranding of the boys, without any adult supervision, represents a clean slate upon which they have the power to build a small society without reference to any past authorities (past governments, religion, etc.). The abundance of food and water and all the necessities sets the stage for a utopia, or perfect society. The actions of the boys demonstrate the spectrum of governments, with Ralph and Piggy representing democratic ideals while Jack represents more authoritarian systems.</li>
        <li>Another analogy compares the three principal characters to the three Archangels of the Old Testament. Ralph equates to St Michael, the general of the Armies of the Lord; Jack to Lucifer, the fallen angel who takes a hoard of lesser angels with him turning them into demons opposed to God in the process; and Piggy to Gabriel, whose trumpet call announces Judgement Day.</li>
